# Javascript-testing

## About This Project
This project is based on the concept of test-driven javascript programming. Here, I have used the starter code given by Udacity and the
jasmine testing framework to create a series of test suites for the efficiency of my application.

## Getting Started
* To load the feed reader app with the jasmine specsheet simply clone this repository or create a pull request.Get more information about pull requests [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
* If you aren't comfortable with either of these, another option would be to simply download the zip file.
* Download or fork the application from [here.](https://github.com/2567910/Feed-Reader-Testing/)
* Select the index.html file to start the application.
